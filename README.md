## 1. How to Mint and Read The Genesis Heist Comic

The Genesis Heist is an ERC-721 dApp built and deployed on Ethereum Classic blockchain using Solidity smart contracts and React programming language. 
To interact with the program, ensure your MetaMask wallet is configured on Ethereum Classic. For those not familiar with this network configuration, a guide can be found in the section below. Fund your wallet with 1 ETC allowing for minting gas fees and proceed to mint your comic. Don't forget to follow the project on Twitter and Telegram to interact with community members also searching for clues to crack the secret code to the cipher.

## 3. How to Acquire ZEUS to Operate Zeus Encryption Program
ZEUS is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum Classic blockchain and can be swapped for underlying asset ETC.
- ZEUS Contract Address: ``0x66e97838A985cf070B9F955c4025f1C7825de44F``

After acquiring ETC from your favorite CEX, head over to https://app.hebeswap.com and swap some ETC for ZEUS on the decentralised exchange.

## 4. How to Run Zeus Encryption Program Locally on Your Machine
You can run Zeus Encryption application locally on your machine using NodeJS and npm server instace with instructions below:
- Access the NodeJS website and download the NodeJS LTS package https://nodejs.org/en
- Install NodeJS and open CMD as admin and check the instance of npm server running by typing ``npm -v``
- Proceed to install live server globally using this command: ``npm install -g live-server``
- Once install is complete you can download the ZeusEncryption v1.2 file from GitHub and store in C:\ZeusEncryption
- Navigate your folder structure using ``cd..`` or ``cd`` "FolderName" until your directory points to the C:\ZeusEncryption folder
- You can now launch the application by typing ``live-server`` into CMD command prompt. Wait for application to open on 127.0.0.1:8080
- Zeus Encryption should now open and you can connect your wallet, deposit 10,000 ZEUS and proceed to encrypt/decrypt your data.

## 5. Future Project Development
As the community around the project forms and continues to grow in anticipation for the launch of ZEUS Mail, we encourage education to onboard new people to experience the innovative solutions presented by blockchain networks and applications. Follow our social channels for updates on the project including our digital celestial art artifacts.
